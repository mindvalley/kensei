h1. About TensaiCMS

No databases.
No hassles.
No shit.
That's genius!
No. That's Tensai.

h2. History

Tensai is a file-based content management system written in PHP using the Zend framework. It was extracted by isieo and kaliwanagan from their work in Indigo, used by "Mindvalley LC,":http://www.mindvalley.com an Internet Marketing company specializing in the personal development genre.

h2. Features

* No database: Tensai does not need a database to run; it only needs a web server and PHP. Without any extra database server to maintain, deployment is quick and hassle-free. A deployment at its simplest can consist of simply copying over the entire program tree.
* Model-View-Controller architecture: Tensai was designed to be easily maintanable, and this attribute was very influential in how Tensai was structured. A web page's layout resides in partials that content writers need not worry about.
* Extensibility: Additional functionality can easily be added by content writers in the form of tags (which are able to use their own partials as well). For example, a video player that gracefully degrades from HTML5 to Flash to a static image can easily be embedded in a page just by inserting the media_player tag.
